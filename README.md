This project is under a lot of work and is still in an early stage.
## Why rust?

As you can see this project is written in Rust, both in frontend using web assembly, and in backend. Which for web apps may be different from the standard but there are good reasons for its use. The first one is performance, although WASM is still developing many interactions that still need JS underneath, which makes it not fast enough even so it's pretty *blazingly fast* using SSR and encryption for small space payloads. Another reason and the most important is the functionalities that the language offers you, which allows us to make the implementation very comfortable in development, without to mention another multiple benefits that it brings.
